# python-playground
A brief history of snakes and ladders.

## What's this about?
Nothing. Nothing here.

## Getting started

Install python3 via homebrew, apt, or pkg.

If you just want to play games, or explore python, that's all you need.

If you want to play using jupyter notebook and caffe2, continue:

Install
pip3, setuptools, and virtualenvwrapper.

Create your own venv, and continue installation on pip packages:
```bash
pip install
    future \
    numpy \
    protobuf \
    pyyaml \
    six \
    graphviz \
    hypothesis \
    ipython \
    jupyter \
    matplotlib \
    notebook \
    pydot \
    python-nvd3 \
    pyyaml \
    requests \
    scikit-image \
    scipy
```

I recommend installing pip packages over a venv to avoid conflicting packages
with your personal env.
